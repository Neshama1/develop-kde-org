# Visual Studio Code

Microsoft Visual Studio Code (VS Code) is a popular cross-platform, general-purpose, open source IDE. Thanks to its powerful extensions ecosystem it supports many languages as well as deep customization options for themes, fonts, keyboard controls, and more.

### Setup

The KDE build tool [kdesrc-build](../index-5.md) can automatically generate the configuration files needed for VS Code to work with KDE projects.

To enable this feature, first ensure that `kdesrc-build` is installed and configured; then enable the feature in the `kdesrc-build` configuration file (located at `~/.config/kdesrc-buildrc` by default) - ensure these options are in the `global` section and set to `true`:

```bash
global
    # ... other settings ...

    compile-commands-linking true
    compile-commands-export true

    generate-vscode-project-config true
end global
```

With these settings, projects built by `kdesrc-build` will have the hidden `.vscode` folder created in their source directory; for example, for KCalc this would be `kde/src/kcalc/.vscode`.

The configuration files are generated when a project is built or rebuilt with `kdesrc-build`. If you have already built the project you want to work on before enabling the `generate-vscode-project-config` option, make sure to rebuild it before opening it in VS Code.

### Working on a project

We will use [KCalc](https://apps.kde.org/kcalc/) as an example.

{% hint style="success" %}Tip The [Command Palette](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/userinterface#\_command-palette) (`Ctrl+Shift+P`) is your friend. It allows you to search for and run commands and it is a great way to discover features. {% endhint %}

#### Opening the project

The project can be opened as a workspace in vs code by opening the src directory as a folder:

* `File` -> `Open Folder...`
* Select the project's source code directory: `~/kde/src/kcalc`

If you have the `kdesrc-build` configuration set up as described above, VS Code will automatically detect the `.vscode` folder and load the project with the correct settings.

The following configuration sections will only need to be done the first time you open a new project in VS Code.

#### Installing extensions

A notification popup at the bottom-right of the window will ask if you want to install the recommended extensions for working on this project:

![Screenshot of the prompt to install recommended extensions](../../../../content/docs/getting-started/building/ide/visual-studio-code/recommended-extensions-prompt.png)

These extensions add support to VS Code for technologies commonly used in KDE projects, such as CMake, C++, Qt, and more.

Click `Install`.

#### Configuring the project

After the extensions have been installed:

* If a notification prompt asks if you want to switch to a pre-release version of the C++ extension, click `No`.
* A notification prompt will ask `Would you like to configure project "kcalc"?` Click `Yes`.

![Screenshot of the prompt to configure the project](../../../../content/docs/getting-started/building/ide/visual-studio-code/configure-project-prompt.png)

A prompt will open at the top-middle of the window asking to choose a kit (a set of predefined configurations used when building and running the project). Select `Unspecified` to have the kit chosen automatically based on the project and system configuration:

![Screenshot of the prompt to select a kit](../../../../content/docs/getting-started/building/ide/visual-studio-code/select-kit-prompt.png)

The integrated terminal will open at the bottom of the window, and if the project was configured successfully, the last line should say:

```
[cmake] -- Build files have been written to: /home/<username>/kde/build/kcalc
```

![Screenshot of the terminal showing successful configuration](../../../../content/docs/getting-started/building/ide/visual-studio-code/configuration-successful.png)

You are ready to start working on the code with VS Code! ðŸŽ‰

#### Debugging

To start debugging, click on the `Run and Debug` icon on the left sidebar, then click on the green play button to start debugging.

![Screenshot of how to start a debug session](../../../../content/docs/getting-started/building/ide/visual-studio-code/run-and-debug.png)

If the project has multiple targets it will open a prompt at the top-middle of the window asking to choose a target. Select the target you want to debug; in this case, `kcalc`:

![Screenshot of the prompt to select a target](../../../../content/docs/getting-started/building/ide/visual-studio-code/initial-launch-target.png)

We should now be running a debug session of the `kcalc` project. ðŸš€

![Screenshot of the debug session](../../../../content/docs/getting-started/building/ide/visual-studio-code/debug-session.png)

To later change the target, open the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P`) and run the `CMake: Set Debug Target` command.

#### Debugging KCMs

{% hint style="info" %}
Note

The configurations for KCMs are only generated by the newer `kde-builder` build tool, and not by the legacy `kdesrc-build` tool.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
Note

{% endhint %}

We'll use the `plasma-workspace` project as an example, as it contains many `KDE Configuration Modules` (KCMs).

Open the build target selector by clicking the button (defaults to `all`):

![Screenshot of button to choose the build configuration](../../../../content/docs/getting-started/building/ide/visual-studio-code/kcm-choose-build-button.png)

Filter for KCMs by typing `kcm_` in the popup, and choose one of the options marked `MODULE_LIBRARY` that represents a KCM:

![Screenshot filtering build targets for available KCMs](../../../../content/docs/getting-started/building/ide/visual-studio-code/kcm-choose.png)

Now you can start debugging the KCM by selecting the `kcm` launch configuration and clicking the green play button:

![Screenshot of choosing the kcm launch configuration](../../../../content/docs/getting-started/building/ide/visual-studio-code/kcm-start-debugging.png)

The KCM will open in a new window, and the debugger will hit breakpoints in the C++ code. Breakpoints in QML are sadly not possible.

![Screenshot of kcm running](../../../../content/docs/getting-started/building/ide/visual-studio-code/kcm-running.png)

#### Debugging with external executables

When developing a library, it may be convenient to launch an application that uses it from the current project. For example, working with Ark's libraries used in Dolphin context menu actions. You can set your run configuration to launch a custom binary, such as `dolphin`.

To do that, follow these steps:

1. Open your `launch.json` file (Run -> Open Configurations).
2. Copy the existing launch configuration from the `configurations` entry in `launch.json` and paste it as a new one.
3. In the `name` field, use something meaningful; for example "Launch Dolphin" so you will recognize it from the run configuration dialog.
4. In the `program` field, use the path to the executable to be run. For example, `/home/username/kde/usr/bin/dolphin`.
5. Save the `launch.json` file.

             // Debug a KCM.
             "name": "kcm",
             "type": "cppdbg",
```

</details>

Now open "Run" [view](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/userinterface#\_views) from the Activity Bar. Select newly appeared "Launch Dolphin" configuration.

When you debug with this configuration Ark will be built, but Dolphin will be launched, and the IDE can still hit breakpoints in the Ark code.

### Troubleshooting

* Reloading the window (Command Palette -> `Developer: Reload Window`) can fix some issues, and cause notifications/prompts to reappear if they were missed.
* Command Palette -> `CMake: Delete Cache and Reconfigure` or `CMake: Reset CMake Tools Extension State (For troubleshooting)` can be useful if things are not working as expected.

{% hint style="info" %}
Note

In case something goes wrong in config generation, if using kde-builder, you can use the `ide_project_configs` logger. Create the file `~/.config/kde-builder-logging.yaml` with the following content:

```yaml
loggers:
  ide_project_configs:
    level: DEBUG
    handlers: [console-named]
```

After that, run kde-builder as normal, and you will see corresponding debug messages.
{% endhint %}

### Tips

* The [Command Palette](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/userinterface#\_command-palette) (`Ctrl+Shift+P`) is your friend. It allows you to search for and run commands, and is a great way to discover features.
* There is extensive documentation available for VS Code at https://code.visualstudio.com/docs.
* There are first-party video tutorials available at https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/introvideos.

### Notes

The templates for the `.vscode` configuration files are available [here](https://invent.kde.org/sdk/kdesrc-build/-/tree/master/data/vscode) if you need to reference them or create them manually.

# Introduction

This tutorial will guide you in publishing a new application on [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps).

We assume that the application you want to publish on Google Play is already packaged and published in one of KDE's F-Droid repositories. If not then read the tutorial on [packaging and publishing applications for Android](../index-1.md).

If, in the past, your application was published on Google Play by uploading APKs then read the tutorial on [publishing new releases of old applications on Google Play](releasing-old-apps.md).
